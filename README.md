# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
In this challenge we are dealing with a mockup company called PlanMyTrip that is a top travel technology company specializing in internet related services within the hotel and travel industry. 

### Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data you gathered in this module, use your API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

### Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

### Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customer’s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.

### Resources
Data Sources: • WeatherPy_Database.csv file we created
Software: Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8 • Language Python 3/10.4 (PythonData) • 
Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, json, time, requests, os, and citipy module
Online resources: OpenWeatherMap, Google Clouds Maps Platform

## Results
I was able to create beautiful maps that were easy to read and provided details of the cities and an itinerary.  The details included the current weather description as well as hotel names, city and country.

## Summary
I think the customers will be happy with the results.  All the information they need in a visually appealing format.
